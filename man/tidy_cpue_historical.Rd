\arguments{
\item{dat}{Data from \code{\link[=get_cpue_historical]{get_cpue_historical()}}.}

\item{species_common}{A species common name in lowercase.}

\item{year_range}{A range of years to include. Can go up to current year but
note the management changes, particularly in 1996.}

\item{area_grep_pattern}{A major statistical area as a regular expression.}

\item{use_alt_year}{Should the alternate year (e.g. fishing year) column
\code{alt_year} be used? If \code{FALSE} then the calendar year will be used. If this
is set to \code{TRUE} then the \code{year} column will be replaced with the
\code{alt_year} column.}

\item{depth_band_width}{The depth band widths in m.}

\item{depth_bin_quantiles}{Quantiles for the depth bands. If the cumulative
proportion of positive fishing events within a given depth bin is less then
the lower amount or greater than the upper amount then that depth bin will
be dropped.}

\item{min_bin_prop}{If the proportion of fishing events for any given factor
level is less than this value then that factor level will be dropped.}

\item{type}{Should the trip-level data be returned (for possible future index
standardization) or should the arithmetic CPUE be returned (species
specific catch and all effort is summed each year and then divided.)}

\item{max_fe_hours}{The maximum number of allowable hours per fishing event
(e.g. per trawl). Fishing events that are longer than this will be removed.
This can be used to remove erroneous fishing events. Only affects data in
1991 and after when the data are recorded as fishing events.}
}
\value{
A (tibble) data frame.
}
\description{
The function can create trip level historical CPUE for index standardization
or an "arithmetic" CPUE where the catch and effort are summed each year and
divided.
}
\details{
Note that fishing events prior to 1991 are 'rolled up' in the databases to
locality-specific trips. This function well aggregate fishing events into
trips in 1991 and after to create a consistent form of data.
